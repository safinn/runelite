/**
 * The built in FPS overlay has a few problems that this one does not have, most of all: it is distracting.
 * 1. The built in one also shows memory, which constantly fluctuates and garbage collects.
 * It is useful for devs profiling memory.
 * 2. The built in one shifts around constantly because it is not monospace.
 * This locks "FPS:" into one position (the far top right corner of the canvas),
 * along with a locked position for the FPS value.
